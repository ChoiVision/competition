# Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification

## Insight
- Firstly, My team found very small whale in images
- So we focus on whale for accurate identification
- We used an annotation tool called labelme to create our own yolo data.
- It was an inaccessible problem due to simple classification problems such as the MNIST.
- Because the Test dataset has an object called "unidentitfied" that Train dataset does not have.

### Our team couldn't use all the folds. Because it took a very long time to learn, and the resources given to us were limited.

## Things that I regret not being able to try.
    - Use TPU
        - Many Kagglers use tpu and tf record when they train huge dataset
        
    - Unsupervised functions also have a tremendous impact on performance. 
        - In this part, in-depth concepts and studies are needed.

## Things I learned.
    - Even in deep learning, good data is a must, not an option.
    - The loss function has an important influence on the train.
